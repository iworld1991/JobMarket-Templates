# Tools for making the contents of your JHU server folder

Steps:

0. Read `mymoniker_README.sty` and follow the instructions therein
0. Replace the dummy content in these files with your real content:
   * Abstract.tex : four items
      - Abstract for your dissertation as a whole (brief) 
      - Abstract for your Job Market Paper 
      - Abstract for your Next paper (brief)
      - Abstract for your Last paper (brief)
0. If you are on linux or MacOS, run the script `./moniker-dir-make.sh`
   * If you are on Windows you can:
      - do the same steps by hand;
      - Or write a bat file (if you want to endear yourself to the JMPO, you could make a PR for the bat file so I can merge it in here!)
